Looks good I guess. hehe. Let's do this all.  -->

Hello, *kawan*.

I am Daud, currently unemployed with one short job experience. A (kinda) fresh graduate in Statistics from Universitas Gadjah Mada. It's supposed to be a place where I **pridely** put all my portfolios. Will it come in handy, someday, in the future, though?

Nope. Probably not.

## Just whine for a bit
I always think that I'm pretty skillful in lots of data-related tasks. Although in reality, I'm just another mediocre in this field. I'd love working with data: getting some contexts out of their abstractness, building a useless utterly-complex machine learning model just for fun, copy-pasting lines of codes into some projects, and anything else in between. 

It's another boring afternoon. Sitting on a chair, in a damp stuffy bedroom. Overthinking everything, keep replanning things, without any actual execution. 

*Sigh*. I always believe that things will eventually get better, since that what life is all about. One even said that we just had to keep learning, and pushing in any kind of situation.

So here I am. Wasting my time typing all this nonsense. Trying to stay sane despite all the boredom creeping inside the body.
